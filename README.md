# Crestron-Home-Assistant
Driver to integrate a Home Assistant system with a Crestron system so the devices 
and services connected to the Home Assistant system can be leveraged in the Crestron 
system.

This driver is designed to allow a Crestron programmer to leverage Home Assistant as 
a gateway to the off-the-shelf smart home devices and services that can be integrated
without having to become an expert in Home Assistant.  No knowlege of YAML is required.
The code is designed to work with individual entities in Home Assistat.  For example, a
power monitoring smart plug could have a switch entity for controlling the plug and a
sensor entity for providing the measured power consumed by the device plugged into the 
smart plug.  This paradigm provides both power and flexibility in working with smart
home devices and services integrated with Home Assistant.

This module suite is released as shareware.  It is free for a developer to 
use on their own personal Crestron system or for a dealer to use in their 
showroom demo system.  However, if it is used on customer systems, where a 
dealer or programer will profit from it, then I ask for a single payment 
of $150 from the dealer or programmer.  

What you get is 

1) My thanks
2) Permission for the dealer or programmer to use the module on as many 
client projects as they want
3) A copy of the C# source code for the module (only a binary executable 
is included with the example program)
4) Good Karma
